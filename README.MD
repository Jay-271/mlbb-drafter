# Public version of the MLBB-AI-Drafter Repo

> ðŸ’¡ Note: This webapp requires backend requires to function properly. If you'd like to see the fully functioning version of this app, please contact me via email at jasonavilasoria@gmail.com.

Here's a quick look at what the app does (however, if you'd like to run the frontend yourself see [this](#no-access)):

1. Loads models all trained locally. Model architectures include:
    - Deep LSTM models
    - Enchanced Convid LSTM models
    - Parallel Convid GRU models
    - Deep Convid models
    - & Many more, including "Bigger" versions of each one above for a total of 18 <strong> Unique Models!</strong>
2. Once loaded, hero data is given to the frontend and looks like this when the form is populated:
    - ![MainImage](/img/main.png) 
3. The populated dropdowns look as such:
    - ![PopImage](/img/pop.png)
4. Here, you are free to choose your draft. Familiarity with `Mobile Legends` is important but not necessary.
    - Banned Heros will *NOT* be part of the prediction
5. After choosing your draft, enter how many reccomdations you'd like. This will change the prediction count and be easier on your system (if running locally).

6. This image is who the models think **you** should pick next. Every hero changes predictions! 
    - ![Main3Image](/img/main3.png)
7. This image is who the models think **the enemy** will pick next. Every hero changes predictions! 
    - ![Main4Image](/img/main4.png)
8. Finally, If you disagree, these models are based off of community feedback, further reinforcing the picks. The suggestions are stored and models are trained on these suggestions weekly

## Access

If you've been given access to help me out developing this app, please see the `README` in the [Backend](/backend/README.MD) folder!

## No access

If no access to the models or backend has been granted, you can use a limited version of the app by running a `development build` of Node. Here's how:
* Install the latest version of Node.
1. Run `cd frontend`
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`

Remember, some options will not be populated and you will mostly see the frontend with little functionality.
